# RNA_Squence_Analysis
Single-Cell-Gene-Expression-Scanpy
This repository contains the code for analyzing single-cell gene expression data using Scanpy.

Overview
The project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data using the Scanpy library. The code provided in the Jupyter notebook (Single-Cell-Gene-Expression-Scanpy.ipynb) performs various preprocessing steps, including filtering cells and genes, normalization, quality control, dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP), clustering (Louvain algorithm), and gene expression analysis. The analysis focuses on identifying differentially expressed genes across clusters and visualizing the results.

Dataset
The analysis is conducted on the Ensemble DNA Soft Masked Primary Assembly dataset, which consists of single-cell RNA sequencing data. The dataset is obtained from the provided file paths (matrix.mtx, genes.tsv, barcodes.tsv.gz), and the necessary preprocessing steps are performed accordingly.

Dependencies
To run the code, the following dependencies need to be installed:

scanpy
igraph
louvain
Please make sure to install these dependencies using the provided pip commands or the appropriate package manager.

Usage

Install the required dependencies: pip install scanpy igraph louvain
Open the Jupyter notebook: Single-Cell-Gene-Expression-Scanpy.ipynb
Follow the code in the notebook to analyze the single-cell gene expression data.
Modify the code or parameters as needed for your own analysis.
Note: The file paths in the code may need to be updated based on the location of the dataset files on your system.
